      description: `OAK is an onchain community currency supporting local businesses in Oakland, California. Local currencies can circulate value locally, save small businesses money, and support local causes - join us in your city. 

Crypto lets us free ourselves from big banks and financial companies that extract value every time we swipe a credit card. With blockchain weâ€™re empowered to exchange value independently peer-to-peer.

For our Onchain Summer collection OAK has teamed up with and will be splitting mint proceeds with local artist Brandon Ruffin, a photographer, web3 futurist, filmmaker, and writer based in Oakland.

Brandon currently works on a research team in the area of Computational Photography at Google pushing the capabilities of machine learning and traditional photography, and is a contributor for publications such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, and the SF Chronicle.

Onchain Summer collectors will receive tiered perks such as exclusive updates, 1:1 calls, and a one-time future gift of OAK at an IRL event.`,
