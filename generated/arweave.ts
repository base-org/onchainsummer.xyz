For the first time, developers were able to build applications that connected people no matter where they lived, bringing them together to read, write, and share information. This unlocked incredible new products, including streaming, search, social media, smartphones, and more.\n\nToday, we believe we’re on the verge of the next massive transformation: onchain. Onchain is the next generation of the internet that will increase economic freedom globally by putting ownership back in the hands of everyday people — and it’s growing fast.\n\nBase Day One commemorates that story, and acknowledges the fact that it will evolve as more people come onchain and collectively create what comes next.\n\nBase is for everyone. Mint to join us as we bring the world onchain.',

      body: '***Learn about the digital renaissance of onchain art through the visionary vantage point of Cozomo de’ Medici, a prolific and notorious anonymous collector.*** ***Mint on [onchainsummer.xyz/fwb](https://onchainsummer.xyz/fwb)***\n\n"My story started by accident,” recalls the anonymous art collector known only as Cozomo de’ Medici. “I found this growing community of digital artists in the summer of 2021 like so many others. Back then, digital art was bundled together with all sorts of speculative projects. Two years later, digital art is its own category, with a growing ecosystem of collectors, artists and builders.”\n\nOver those years, Cozomo has amassed a collection of art worth millions of dollars, donated notable works to the LACMA, and had his identity questioned again and again (at one point, Twitter was convinced he was Snoop Dogg — [which Snoop Dogg teasingly affirmed](https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1440038460417474567?lang=en)). Yet beyond the speculation, Cozomo has proven himself to be a forward-thinking visionary who’s capable of recognizing the power of both the past and the future. "I\'m grateful to stand on the shoulders of those who paved this path for us all,” says Cozomo, “The artists minting work that wouldn’t even sell for pennies at the time. Things like [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) that were *free* to claim. It’s those early creatives who are the real visionaries of this movement."\n\nIt’s because of this deep level of understanding in the art space that Cozomo was asked by [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/), a social community of creatives and artists, to curate their contribution to Onchain Summer. Cozomo commissioned DeeKay Motion, a master animator and one of the definitive stars of the digital art movement, to create ‘New Era’. “To commemorate the launch of such a significant step for the onchain space,” says Alex Zhang, the Mayor of FWB, “we wanted to bring together two major figures of the ecosystem.” Cozomo himself owns several pieces of DeeKay’s collection, one of which was acquired for $1 million dollars in April of 2022. "And now DeeKay has created something that everyone can have in their wallet," says Cozomo excitedly.\n\nSo what *is* Cozomo’s vision for the future?\n\n"We’ve seen major museums embrace crypto art, digitally native artists sell works at major auction houses, traditional art collectors acquire digital works into their collection, and much more. So I see Onchain Summer as a manifestation of how far we have come."\n\nYet he believes we have a long way to go. "What is holding some artists and collectors back,” says Cozomo, “is the actual chain. Not too long ago, artists couldn\'t afford to mint new art, as the transaction fees on ETH were too high. That cost would be priced into the artwork. That’s what makes the idea of Base exciting: A secure chain that is affordable to millions of artists, that can be collected by billions worldwide. That is what will allow this movement to rise even further.”\n\nCozomo hopes that many more follow in his footsteps and participate in this burgeoning digital renaissance. "The odds of you being alive at the birth of a major art movement is close to zero,” says Cozomo. “If you are participating in Onchain Summer, you are not only here to see the birth of a major art movement, but you are actually able to help shape it. That to me is incredibly exciting."',

      body: '***Parallel\'s onchain card game joins the thrill of collecting with the power of onchain art. Parallel is setting the stage for a future where players reign supreme. Mint at [onchainsummer.xyz/parallel](https://onchainsummer.xyz/parallel)***\n\n<https://youtu.be/mk1zOITT85E>\n\nAt the forefront of onchain gaming stands Parallel, a visionary card game which launched in 2022 and took the blockchain ecosystem by storm. Led in part by Kohji Nagata, the Head of Game Design, Parallel aims to craft an immersive experience which expands out into a full-fledged sci-fi universe. The decision to start with a card game was intentional, driven by Nagata\'s passion for collecting and trading cards. Parallel exists to create an experience that celebrates the trading aspect of collectible card games while creating an enticing experience for players of all levels of onchain experience.\n\nIn contrast to traditional card games which are rooted in the physical world, digital card games offer many new opportunities, but historically have been strangely limited."The biggest issue that I have with digital card games today,” says Nagata, “is that you spend all this money on these cards, but you don’t actually ‘own’ them." Indeed, many of the most popular digital card games today allow users to spend money opening new packs of cards, but offer no ability to trade (or sell) them. By providing players with onchain cards that are tradable, sellable, and even capable of earning tokens through gameplay, Parallel bridges the gap between virtual and real-world ownership. In comparison, other digital card games lack a *true* sense of ownership, as players find themselves at the mercy of centralized platforms that control what they’ve bought.\n\nParallel’s onchain game allows players to not only own their cards but also trade and sell them freely on a decentralized and open market. Each card can be purchased from other players on secondary markets, or from Parallel in the form of packs. "For Onchain Summer,” Nagata says, “we are giving users on Base the ability to acquire a full deck of onchain cards.”\n\nParallel’s Starter Pack grants players access to a set of cards called ‘Parallel Beta’ as well as a deck of 40 playable cards for specific Parallel Factions: Kathari, Marcolian, Earthen, Shroud, and Augencore. In addition, the Starter Pack includes a card back exclusive to Base.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kYzapyneWZUSQ5WpYEq6V.png?height=550&width=1200)\n\nEven though onchain cards are an important part of the Parallel experience, the team makes it clear that they want to make a game that’s accessible to everyone, utilizing a free-to-play experience where players can utilize ‘ephemeral’ versions of the cards which maintain the core gameplay functionality but lack features only found in their onchain counterparts.\n\nParallel\'s ambitious vision extends beyond the confines of its card game. Nagata envisions a future where players can unleash their creativity and use the cards as a sandbox for their own projects. He points out that many of the most successful games being played today were in fact born as modifications of other games, proving that possibilities are limitless when creators are given the right tools. As he says, "I imagine someone getting their hands on Parallel assets in the future and making something new, and then our cards now unlock new assets which let you play a completely different game. That’s the dream."',

Mint at [onchainsummer.xyz/Coca-Cola](https://onchainsummer.xyz/Coca-Cola)***\n\n“The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about Coca-Cola® is joy,” says Wonderbuhle, one of the emerging artists highlighted in Coca-Cola®s ‘Masterpiece’ collection. Joy certainly feels like the driving force behind the brand’s new collection of onchain art, featuring a diverse array of iconic artworks from around the world.\n\nThe Masterpiece collection uniquely brings together iconic artworks along with new works from emerging talents, all intertwined with the iconic Coca-Cola® bottle. Classic masterpieces like "The Scream" by Edvard Munch and "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer find a harmonious coexistence alongside contemporary works by talented artists like Aket and Vikram Kushwah. Each of these creations now takes on a new dimension as they become onchain collectibles, accessible to art enthusiasts participating in Onchain Summer.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tHp1UonCgM8EkLUuVLXBU.png?height=655&width=1080)\n\nAket, a featured artist hailing from France behind ‘Divine Idyll’, offers his perspective into the significance of the brand, stating, "Coca-Cola® is a super important generational marker. Their advertisements encourage us to live our dreams every day." This sentiment speaks to the enduring impact of Coca-Cola®\'s stories, which transcend time and inspire creative pursuits across generations and cultures.\n\nThrough "Masterpiece," Coca-Cola® works as a curator weaving a narrative that transcends borders and celebrates artistic diversity. “I’m proud to be a part of Masterpiece,” says Fatma Ramadan, a visual artist from Egypt, “because my work will be shown alongside a diverse group of artists from different countries.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PVPgi-3K-mUECJRb6lJPr.png?height=1298&width=2148)\n\n‘Masterpiece’ by Coca-Cola® is not just an art collection, but an embodiment of the dynamic convergence between art, technology, and human connection — and by taking it onchain, Coca-Cola® is leading the way for other brands and industries to explore innovative ways of engaging with our new digital age. This collection transcends the physical limitations of a traditional art gallery, expanding its reach and impact across the globe.\n\nVikram Kushwah: “Coca-Cola® brings people together,” says Kushwah. “Thanksgiving, Christmas, Diwali… I can’t see them without Coca-Cola.”\n\n*Divine Idyll, © Aket 2022*\n\n*You Can’t Curse Me, © WonderBuhle 2022*\n\n*Falling in Library, © Vikram Kushwah, 2012*\n\n*Natural Encounters, © Stefania Tejada, 2020*\n\n*The Blow Dryer, © Fatma Ramadan, 2021*\n\n*Girl with a Pearl Earring, c.1665-6 (oil on canvas), Vermeer, Jan (Johannes) (1632-75) / Mauritshuis, The Hague, The Netherlands / Bridgeman Images*\n\n*Scream, Munch, Edvard (1863-1944) / Private Collection / Photo © O.

      body: "***anotherblock harmonizes nostalgia with innovation, delivering a modern equivalent to cherished musical artifacts. In the rapidly evolving landscape of the music industry, going onchain may provide a solution for empowering artists and fans alike. Mint on <https://onchainsummer.xyz/anotherblock>***\n\nWe live in a world where music has become ubiquitous. So what does it mean to truly “own” a song? This was easy to answer in the era of vinyl records and CDs, where fans cherished physical copies of their favorite albums and put them on display in the middle of their living rooms, but in the age of streaming, such clarity no longer exists.\n\nThis is something that anotherblock hopes to correct by providing a new level of depth through onchain assets. The platform provides a platform for rightsholders to sell shares of ownership in songs. This means that when you mint some of the songs available, you are eligible to collect money when the song is played on streaming services. Reflecting on the company’s roots, founding team member and Head of Product Oscar Morkeeth points out that being based in Sweden has given them a unique perspective on the rise of Spotify in what he playfully calls their “cold little country.”\n\n“We want to turn music lovers and music fans into music owners,” says Morkeeth, who believes that the advent of onchain technology has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for artists to regain control over their art. Through tokenization and decentralized marketplaces, musicians can ensure their work is not lost in the hands of corporate giants. anotherblock's approach aims to strike a delicate balance between empowering artists and engaging fans in a mutually beneficial relationship. By building something for fans, the team envisions a dynamic ecosystem where artists and their supporters form an unbreakable bond, nurturing a thriving and collaborative community.\n\nMorkeeth articulates, “One of the things we’ve lost when music became digital is the sense of physicality. People want to have that feeling again.” Onchain technology provides the perfect conduit to reintroduce the concept of ownership in the digital age. In today's era of ephemeral digital experiences, many people yearn for something tangible to hold on to, something that carries emotional value.\n\nFor Onchain Summer, anotherblock has planned three drops that exemplify their commitment to rekindling the meaning of music ownership. Boys Noize, the renowned DJ and artist from Berlin who has been pushing the boundaries of electronic music for over two decades, is releasing an open edition of the track ICH R U celebration of its 10-year anniversary. Laidback Luke is sharing an unreleased song, Originator, exclusively for the Base community. Kleerup, a Swedish electropop musician, is sharing a never-before-heard demo which serves as a pre-access ticket to buy ownership in the release of his single \"PARADISE\" this fall, giving his audience a chance to be directly involved in his creative process and become part of the story behind the music.\n\nanotherblock's commitment to exploring ownership is not only about preserving the emotional attachment between fans and artists, but also about protecting artists' creative works as a whole. Morkeeth points out, “Bob Dylan recently sold his whole catalog. Justin Bieber sold his. These cherished songs are getting chewed up by private investors, and there’s no open market even though millions of people love that work. We’re working on changing all that.”\n\nTo do so, anotherblock is taking things onchain —but the team also recognizes the importance of accessibility and inclusivity when integrating new digital solutions into the music landscape. Morkeeth emphasizes, “Doing things onchain shouldn’t feel hard. Every new technology start om s off very limited, and it’s time to build culture and bring a new wave of people into this space that we love.“ anotherblock recognizes the importance of enabling fans to become genuine stakeholders in the creative process, fostering a deeper appreciation for the art they support. As Morkeeth envisions, “We want people to not only collect but feel a sense of ownership over what they’re collecting. We want to create a platform for fans to be able to truly own music.”\n\nBy letting fans truly own their favorite songs and contribute to an open market for cherished music, anotherblock is pioneering a new wave of cultural transformation. Their vision of a more connected and empowered community of musicians and music lovers may very well be a key part of creating a new and sustainable future for the next generation of artists and their audiences. By embracing onchain technology, anotherblock is paving the way for the democratization of music ownership.",

The Stand With Crypto Alliance is dedicated to uniting a broad network of advocates to make a better future internet with crypto as a core component.\n\nSpeaking to this, the Alliance issued a statement saying, “With lawmakers casting a shadow over the future of onchain technologies, we recognize the urgent need to rally the community.“ That’s why the Stand with Crypto Alliance is hosting a Day of Action during Onchain Summer to unite, amplify, and activate onchain innovation by encouraging supporters to join the movement and voice their support. They noted, “Coinbase has witnessed remarkable momentum in uniting users in the fight for financial freedom – but this movement is bigger than Coinbase."\n\nPrevious initiatives from Stand with Crypto have provided an entry point onto both the onchain ecosystem and rallying advocates to action. Not only was the initial NFT released in April minted over 160,000 times, but an onchain petition garnered over 188,000 signatures. “Meaningfully fighting legislative headwinds will take our collective power,” continued the statement issued by the Alliance. “By providing the tools supporters need to unite the pro-crypto community and effectively advocate, Stand with Crypto will help supporters speak with one resounding voice to impact public policy – and pave the road toward a brighter future for crypto.”\n\nThe alliance requests that those ready to join the movement show their support for crypto innovation and advocacy by participating in two ways: The first is by minting a special Stand with Crypto x Day of Action commemorative NFT. Priced at 0.00435 ETH (representing the 435 congressional districts in the U.S.) all proceeds will go directly to the Stand with Crypto Alliance. The second (limited to U.S. nationals) is to join the [Stand With Crypto Alliance](https://standwithcrypto.org/?action=join-stand-with-crypto).\n\nIn the grand tapestry of economic freedom, the Stand With Crypto Alliance is a shieldbearer for all those working to create a new onchain world. In the spirit of unity, innovation, and advocacy, we all Stand with Crypto – to create a free digital tomorrow.\n\nIf you support clear, sensible crypto legislation in the United States, [mint the commemorative NFT](http://onchainsummer.xyz/standwithcrypto) and [join the alliance](https://standwithcrypto.org/?action=join-stand-with-crypto) to help secure the future of crypto.',

      body: "***Highlight has curated work from four esteemed generative artists: James Merrill, Melissa Wiederrecht, Leander Herzog, and Holger Lippmann — brought onchain. Nat Emodi, founder of Highlight, joined us to discuss the vision behind the drop and how Base is setting the stage for the future of onchain art.***\n\n<https://onchainsummer.xyz/highlight>\n\n“Code-based art has existed for decades,” says Nat Emodi, co-founder of Highlight, “Pretty much ever since computer screens were invented.” Even though the artform isn’t new, it *has* been difficult to collect. While many passionate fans would run code in-browser, there was a lack of permanence — and also a lack of clarity around output. When the very nature of the work is interconnected with its ability to produce different artwork each time, what exactly *is* the art?\n\n“That’s what NFTs and the blockchain have made clear,” says Emodi.\n\nAs generative art has become a core component of onchain art, Highlight emphasizes co-creation between collectors and artists, where various aspects of the minting experience can influence the output of the art itself. The tools which they give creators enable this by allowing different data elements from the minting experience (such as the time of day or the collector’s wallet address) to play a role in the finished result.\n\n“An incredible thing about generative art is the fact that in most cases the artist has never seen your specific artwork until the moment it’s minted,” says Emodi. “The second it's revealed, you are the first person in the world to ever see that artwork, even before the artist. Of course, the artist has spent time designing a system and an algorithm that’s been carefully crafted, but your mint is as much a surprise to them as it is to you. It’s electric.”\n\nHighlight’s ultimate vision is to break down technical barriers that hinder artistic expression, and allow artists to create whatever they want onchain. James Merrill, a multi-disciplinary artist who resides in Vermont, USA, said that his collection for Onchain Summer  is “all about breaking the rules.” “Instead of cohesion across the collection,” Merrill [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/toThePixel/status/1691185102200397825), “I am specifically trying to make the most diverse set of outputs from a single autonomous generative system to date on the blockchain.”\n\nEmodi envisions two significant trends for the future of the internet. The first is an increasing focus on digital ownership, which could redefine the nature of collecting art and culture. The second is for new systems that will make digital assets become generative. Instead of static assets, Emodi believes NFTs will increasingly be unique, personalized, dynamic and co-created., “This will be reminiscent of how the first wave of the internet unlocked new realms of creative expression over the past few decades.” Emodi anticipates a future where platforms like Highlight empower artists to create unique works while introducing millions of new collectors to generative experiences.\n\nHighlight believes that the reduced transaction costs on Base make it an interesting playground for artists to experiment with in comparison to Ethereum mainnet, which Emodi says can be prohibitive not just for collectors, but also for artists.\n\n“Hopefully,” says Emodi, “this means we'll see thousands of artists creating fascinating, beautiful art and millions of new collectors being introduced to generative works for the first time.”",

      body: '***Zora is emerging as a ‘sovereign domain’’ for creators, where the convergence of onchain innovation and artistic imagination reshapes the landscape of online interaction.***\n\n<https://onchainsummer.xyz/zora>\n\nAfter an era of a digital world dominated by the colossal sway of a few tech giants, Dee Goens believes that artists are ready to push the boundaries of what it means to create online. With a resounding call to action against the stranglehold of a corporate, centralized internet, Zora is embarking on a transformative journey to redefine the contours of artistic expression and the very essence of the online experience — and Goens, Zora’s co-founder, wants to bring as many people with them as they can.\n\n"At Zora, we\'re focused on bringing as many artists onchain as possible," says Goens, “And Layer 2s are great for artists because they make bringing work onchain more accessible than ever by reducing gas fees." These gas fees (the transaction cost of creating or minting work onchain) have caused Zora to spin up an L2 of their own. Now, artists can choose between multiple chains for minting their work, including Ethereum, Zora’s own network, and now, Base.\n\nThis level of optionality is part of the very essence of Zora\'s mission: to provide a space where creators, unburdened by the confinements of conventional platforms, can unite in a diversity of forms. 3D art designers to code-based artists, videographers to poets. The digital canvas of Zora is vast, offering artists a space where their imagination is not merely showcased but celebrated in its entirety, and anyone can mint using whatever art forms they prefer - images, videos, sound files, HTML, and even PDFs.\n\n"For Onchain Summer,” says Goens, “We\'re supporting artists in a few ways. We’re rallying the Zora community on Base through a commemorative Based Zorb mint, supporting a variety of creator releases through Zora\'s creator-owned smart contracts, and unlocking new earning opportunities for creators through our new Protocol Rewards."\n\nZora\'s impact resonates beyond this activation. In a digital landscape often eclipsed by profit-driven motives, Zora offers a more utopian vision of authenticity, working to create a new internet for creators, by creators. As their [Manifesto](https://zora.energy/) says: "A place called Zora. Pure internet. Free and valuable. Resonance and connection. Open and shared. Independence and expansion. For all creation." These words echo as a call for change, inviting artists and enthusiasts alike to participate in a movement that charts a course towards an internet where artists take center stage.',

      body: '***Discover how Pixelmon\'s onchain revival breathes new life into the monster-collecting genre, and how Kevin emerged as a symbol of determination and resilience.***\n\nPixelmon, an onchain monster collecting game, is poised for a comeback.\n\n“We’re building an onchain revival to the monster collecting genre,” says CEO Guliano Xiloyannis, who is aiming to capture the hearts of nostalgic gamers who once adored games of a similar genre but now find the established franchises lacking novelty.\n\nBut to talk about Pixelmon, we need to talk about Kevin.\n\nWhen the original Pixelmon collection was released during the peak of the NFT hype-cycle, the project soared to remarkable heights before any of their digital monsters were even revealed. Once the monsters were put on display, the results were (to put it gently) underwhelming. The voxel-based collection of characters felt rushed and not up to the level of quality that collectors expected. Amongst the various monster designs was one that caught the attention of the internet: a blocky-looking, cockeyed zombie, posed on a beach in front of palm trees and given the dubious name of ‘Kevin’.\n\n![The original Kevin art](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LRj9R2wltCShG4DOboiaD.jpg?height=675&width=676)\n\nKevin became the face of not only the unfortunate art of Pixelmon, but everything perceived to be wrong about the NFT space as a whole. Kevin was memed into the limelight, a perfect punchline to describe when expectations and reality look profoundly different.\n\nWhile all signs pointed to this being the end of Pixelmon’s story, it was just the beginning. The project’s path to resurgence took a pivotal turn when it was acquired by Liquid X, an external company with a much clearer mission than its predecessor. Reflecting on the initial challenges faced by the project, Xiloyannis candidly admits, "This is a comeback project. It\'s a project that, in the NFT space, didn\'t live up to the expectations in the first weeks of its life."\n\nThe Pixelmon world is a post-apocalyptic realm where animals have mutated into colorful and fascinating tribes of sometimes not-so-friendly monsters, each of which is represented by an onchain asset. As Xiloyannis explains, "Their onchain counterparts represent IP rights to our monsters within this IP franchise." Under the new leadership’s guidance, Pixelmon underwent a complete and total transformation, being rebuilt “from the bottom up” and updating all artwork, fleshing out the world’s lore, and embracing a transmedia approach that goes beyond gaming into animation, comic books, and more.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes, Xiloyannis states, "If we don\'t get it right the first time, we are going to keep building. We\'re still here, we’re determined, and we\'re going to come out on top." The sentiment fits in perfectly with their Onchain Summer release, immortalizing Kevin by turning him into a physical collectible, redeemed onchain.\n\nXiloyannis emphasizes that the toy represents something larger than just a humorous mishap, "We made this for anyone who believes that the whole crypto ecosystem can make a comeback and have an overall positive impact on the world while owning its past. And in that sense, I believe that Kevin is for everybody."',

Enter Showtime, a pioneering onchain platform that empowers musicians to bridge this gap and establish meaningful connections with their fans.***\n\n<https://onchainsummer.xyz/showtime>\n\n"Why does Justin Bieber have a harder time connecting with his audience than Mr. Beast?"\n\nThat question, posed by Showtime’s founder Alex Masmej, is worth considering. Despite being a household name worldwide, musicians face unique challenges in building direct artist-to-fan connections. "Meanwhile for YouTubers,” Masmej says, “it\'s somehow easier to convince your audience to pay for your products." This disparity highlights the need for change. Musicians need a new approach, one that enables them to connect with their audience in a direct and meaningful way without being impacted by the strict limitations of streaming services.\n\nMasmej thinks Showtime\'s approach provides an apt solution. Rather than merely serving as collectibles, he says that "NFTs should be useful because they unlock something new." Today’s Onchain Summer drop highlights Showtime’s powerful in-app messaging tool, which Masmej believes to be a multi-purposed utility that each artist will treat differently, utilizing it to share new releases, send concert updates, or even release exclusive content.\n\nFeaturing a bevy of remarkable musicians like BLOND:ISH, Rosa Linn, BT, and many more, each with a unique following around the globe, Showtime’s onchain offerings provide collectors not just with a unique piece of onchain memorabilia, but a direct connection to the artists.\n\nBT, a Grammy-nominated pioneer in the trance music space, is releasing an onchain collectible which unlocks an invitation to a call with the artist. Juno-nominee BLOND:ISH’s release gives her audience an interview into her journey onchain, as well as an $ISH tokens which act as “the heart of blondish.world” Rosa Linn’s release acts as a fan membership card (with a physical counterpart) that provides access to a Discord and fan club, and Talia Lahoud’s comes with a private performance of her new music and exclusive chat.\n\nOn top of these perks for all collectors, lucky winners of some of today’s mints will receive special experiences like a trip to Paris to see BT perform live, or BLOND:ISH’s “golden ticket” that enters participants into a raffle to win $6,969 (nice), flights, and two all-access passes to her ABRACADABRA event.\n\nAn onchain future represents a pivotal moment for the music industry that goes far beyond digital collectibles: it’s about connections. The power of onchain technology lies in the ability to empower musicians, enabling them to connect with their audiences on a deeper level. Through Showtime\'s innovative platform, artists can transcend the constraints of traditional channels and forge genuine experiences that redefine the artist-fan relationship.',

In an era where it’s becoming harder and harder to log off, it’s important to find opportunities to get outside.\n\nCentral to the ethos of Mirrors Wellness Club is the notion of inclusivity and community. Venessa Gonzalez, the club’s Event and Relations Manager, emphasizes this core value: "We try to create spaces that welcome everybody. We’ve noticed that people often end up creating group chats after our events and activations, and establishing whole relationships. So it really does become a community of like-minded people finding a place with each other." Beyond the gatherings, Mirrors Wellness Club cultivates a nurturing ecosystem where individuals from diverse backgrounds converge, fostering an environment that thrives on mutual support. This is onchain technology facilitating offchain bonds, a harmonious convergence of the virtual and the physical.\n\nTo continue bringing people into this important space, Mirrors Wellness Club is launching a limited-run membership card for Onchain Summer. In the words of Venessa Gonzalez, "You\'re gonna have a good time, you\'re gonna meet amazing people, you\'re gonna feel good when you leave, and you\'re going to want to keep coming back."\n\nAs Heno aptly observes, the journey towards an onchain future necessitates more bridges between the digital and physical worlds we co-exist in. "To onboard the next wave of people into an onchain future, we need real world applications. We need more education around why this space is important and purposeful." Mirrors Wellness Club serves as an exemplary model, illustrating how onchain technology can be seamlessly woven into real-world experiences.',

      body: '***Indelible Labs is pioneering a frictionless process for artists to securely upload their creations to the blockchain, ushering in a new era of permanence and stability for creative expression.***\n\nBringing art onchain is revolutionizing the way we approach ownership. With its inherent permanence and accessibility, taking a collection of work onchain offers a promising future for artists seeking to find a space for their creations which stands the test of time — but it can be a challenge to find the best way to do so.\n\nMichael Hirsch, the co-founder of Indelible Labs, ran into that headfirst as he began exploring NFTs years ago. "I wanted to create an onchain NFT collection,” Hirsch said, “and realized that there\'s a lot of difficulty that goes into creating specifically onchain NFTs."\n\nTo the Indelible team, the advantages of onchain technology over traditional web 2.0 models are profound. As Hirsch pointed out, hosting a website on a personal server still requires payment for internet service, and even then, the data is not stored in the same way as it would be on the blockchain. The level of permanence and stability offered by onchain art is unparalleled, providing assuring creators that their work will persist throughout the life of the blockchain it resides on. “If your art isn’t onchain,” says Hirsch, “You have decentralized ownership over something, but that something may not be accessible one day.”\n\nTo create more complexity in an already complex subject, many onchain assets are only *partially* onchain, using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) technology to host the assets. While this decentralized technology offers a greater level of freedom than traditional file servers, they still lack permanence as the assets can become inaccessible if they’re ‘unpinned’ on IPFS. That uncertainty can lead to stress, as artists are forced to contend with regular fees to maintain their work’s existence.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Indelible developed the first no-code tool for creating truly onchain NFTs, no IPFS (or recurring fees) necessary. With the innovative platform, artists can easily upload their artwork onchain. Hirsch elaborated on the simplicity of the process: "You literally drag your art in, it generates a smart contract, and it handholds you through uploading your art to the blockchain." The reduced costs associated with this approach made onchain art accessible to a wider audience.\n\nNow Indelible has brought their platform to Base, and is celebrating Onchain Summer with a variety of releases from artists Pablo Stanley, Amber Vittoria, Spottie WiFi, PIV,  ARTJEDI1, and popular collection Degenerate Ape Academy.\n\nThe ability for Indelible to enable artists to create onchain collections has the power to usher in a new era for the art world. Through their no-code platform, onchain art is becoming accessible, affordable, and enduring.',

      body: '***Discover how Manifold is shaping a new era for artists through their Studio and a variety of extensions that let creators customize their work.***\n\n<https://onchainsummer.xyz/manifold>\n\nAt the heart of Manifold\'s philosophy lies the belief that everyone should be fully in charge of their creations. Led in part by co-founder Richerd Chan, Manifold is on a mission to unlock a special set of tools that unlock a new realm of possibilities. "At a high level,” says Chan, “What Manifold does is support creators by building tools for putting their work onchain.” Manifold’s belief that creators should have full ownership and control over their work has led them to develop a platform that puts the artist in the driver seat from start to finish, with creators deploying their own smart contracts and making decisions every step of the way.\n\nManifold provides this level of minute control via extensions: onchain apps that seamlessly integrate with the smart contracts to expand their functionality. These unlock a myriad of creative possibilities. One extension enables the creation of Open Editions, allowing work to be distributed to a broader audience without compromising ownership. Another extension enables creators to reward holders with digital or physical goods. Yet another facilitates the creation of one onchain asset at the cost of the destruction of a different asset (known as ‘burning’), granting creators the freedom to continuously reinvent their offerings.\n\nAs platforms like Manifold soared in popularity, the cost of transactions on Ethereum also soared to unreasonable heights. Chan acknowledges this hurdle, stating, "There\'s a lot of prohibitive things that you can\'t do on Ethereum just because of the cost of operations for it." High transaction fees resulted in the act of creation becoming a burdensome ordeal, impacting creators and making them question if it was worth it to go onchain at all — and some of the extensions that Manifold provides, such as the ability to burn past work, can become quite costly when a user is required to make multiple transactions.\n\nBeyond the reduced transaction cost that L2s like Base provide, Manifold acknowledges that there’s plenty of work ahead in order to onboard a billion users into this ecosystem. “In order to bring the whole world onchain,” says Chan, “We need to reframe what NFTs are. We need to create more compelling content that everyone wants to engage with while giving people access to the things that they really want to interact with."\n\nSlimesunday, one of the artists that Manifold has brought for Onchain Summer, is taking advantage of Manifold’s burn technology to create a reframing of his own with a work entitled ‘The Great Purge’. Acknowledging that “with the explosion of popularity came a dark side,” Sunday is offering a “symbolic cleanse”, requiring collectors to take any asset in their wallet that ended up being a cash-grab and burn it in order to mint this new work.\n\n“My aim is solely to remind the world that NFTs are not just a passing fad,” said Slimesunday in [an announcement](https://twitter.com/slimesunday/status/1691852523907285420/photo/1) about his Onchain Summer creation. “They are a revolutionary technology that can empower artists, foster genuine connections, and inspire a new era of digital creativity.”\n\n“Our mission has always been to serve creators,” says Chan, “So we know that we have to build good tools for collectors to engage with those creators. We do things the right way, and make sure that we have both the çreator’s backs, and in turn, the customer’s back.” Manifold\'s pioneering work in developing creator tools is a testament to the transformative power of bringing work onchain.',

      body: "***Blackbird is reshaping the hospitality landscape, fostering authentic loyalty and engagement between restaurants and their best customers. Discover how their exclusive Onchain Summer passes unlock real-world excitement and sweet rewards for diners.***\n\n<https://onchainsummer.xyz/blackbird>\n\nThe restaurant industry has always been dynamic and ever-evolving. With countless restaurants vying for attention, owners face the challenge of not only attracting new customers but also fostering loyalty among their existing patrons. In this fast-paced environment, technology can be a powerful ally — the trouble is, restaurants and their customers aren’t particularly well connected today, even as point-of-sale machines have grown more advanced.\n\nBlackbird wants to change all that, and is using onchain technology to give restaurant owners around the country the ability to unlock new levels of value for customers. Ben Leventhal, Blackbird’s founder and CEO, envisions a future where taking restaurants onchain enables new levels of connection between these restaurants and their most loyal patrons.\n\n“We've built a small bit of hardware with our NFC chips that really allows for a very easy and direct digital connection between restaurants and customers,” says Leventhal, “and that digital handshake is something that restaurants haven't previously had at their disposal.” By using Blackbird’s technology, business owners can learn a lot about customers, such as when they last came in, what they like to eat, and even where they last sat. The goal is to make the customers feel at home in the establishments they frequent.\n\nOf course, Blackbird has to provide something to keep those customers coming back, and that’s where $FLY tokens come in. A token that guests earn with every ‘tap-in’, $FLY will soon be redeemable for items and rewards, making getting dinner at your favorite restaurant more enticing than ever. Tap in enough times to become a regular and unlock ‘friends and family’ style perks like off-the-menu dishes sent from the kitchen to your table and the ability to text a concierge for a more spontaneous RSVP system than a traditional reservation-based system would allow. Blackbird works with each restaurant partner to create these bespoke rewards programs and loyalty tiers. As Leventhal says, “We've seen that when businesses show their customers what tapping in with Blackbird can get you, they see increased activity at their restaurant.”\n\nIf all this talk has made you hungry, you’ll be happy to know that Blackbird is introducing two exclusive summer passes for Onchain Summer, designed in partnership with the artist Lucian Smith. The first, the Supercharge Summer pass, gives holders a bonus in $FLY tokens for their next tap-in. The second, the Summertime Sweet Pass, gives holders not only $FLY tokens, but a little something more. “To me,” says Ben, “Summer time is about ice cream, sweets, desserts. So with the Summertime Sweet Pass, you earn complimentary sweets at a handful of Blackbird restaurants.” The complimentary ‘sweet surprise’ can be redeemed at eight Blackbird restaurants between August 15th and the 22nd.\n\nThough Blackbird is focused on providing a great summer for participants in Onchain Summer, their impact goes way beyond the passes available today. By incentivizing customers to tap-in and engage with the restaurant onchain, Blackbird hopes those users will become longtime repeat customers at these restaurants. In a competitive landscape where major players like Starbucks continually invest in loyalty programs, Blackbird recognizes the need for independent restaurants to create loyal customers even more diligently. By offering easy and direct digital connections between restaurants and their customers, Blackbird enables these establishments to leverage the power of onchain technology to strengthen customer relationships.\n\nBlackbird is excited for Base to join them in their ambitious goal of removing roadblocks that hinder the adoption of going onchain, bringing the technology to people on a massive scale. As Ben puts it, \"The best news of all is that you don't need to know anything about 'crypto' to unlock the magic of Blackbird. So I would say: Grab yourself a pass and go have some ice cream.\"",

      body: '***Onboard’s onchain vision is propelling financial empowerment across Africa, fueled by a vibrant partnership that celebrates culture and connectivity.***\n\n<https://onchainsummer.xyz/onboard>\n\nYele Bademosi is spending a lot of time thinking about credit — or rather, the lack of it in many African countries. “Did you know,” he asks, “that if you move to Nigeria today and want to rent a house, you have to pay for your rent a year or two in advance? To get an iPhone, you have to pay for it up front? To get a car, you have to pay for it up front? There is no credit. People need access to financial services to live a better life, and right now they simply don\'t have that access."\n\nOnboard, founded by Bademosi, exists to create that access, setting its sights on bridging the gap between traditional financial systems and the digital frontier in order to create equal opportunities for all, regardless of geographic location. With digital access becoming increasingly prevalent, especially among young Africans who often have social media accounts before a bank account, the stage is set for a financial revolution. When asked why an onchain future is so important, Bademosi shared his perspective, saying: "This is the first time where as Africans, we\'re building alongside the rest of the world." By actively participating in the onchain digital economy, Africa is positioning itself as a key player in shaping the future of global technology.\n\nHowever, Bademosi recognizes that there are challenges to overcome in order to make going onchain accessible to everyone. "There are so many questions that need to be answered for the uninitiated,” he says. “There\'s this thing called a wallet address, and another thing called gas. All of these technicalities and hurdles are very difficult for a first-time user." To address this, Onboard aims to create an application layer on top of Base to simplify the onboarding process and make onchain services user-friendly.\n\nFor Onchain Summer, Onboard has partnered with artists and musicians to create commemorative onchain assets. "For a lot of people who might not be aware, one of the biggest exports from the African continent right now is our music,” says Bademosi. “Afrobeats is going crazy right now, being listened to by millions of people across the world. As Africans, we have consistently conveyed our history, challenges, and accomplishments through art”. Onboard wants to bring music and art not only displays but also celebrates the African continent onchain.\n\nThe significance of Onboard’s contribution to Onchain Summer goes beyond just celebrating music and culture. Bademosi sees it as an opportunity to showcase Africa\'s spirit and optimism for the future: "I think our drop is an opportunity to introduce the world to a culture that, despite everything that has gone wrong, still has this sense of happiness and belonging, and excitement for the future."\n\nBy empowering frontier markets in Africa, Onboard is forging a path towards a more inclusive and prosperous future for all. “I see myself as a custodian and champion of this mission and vision,” says Bademosi, “and we\'re calling everyone to join us and build an awesome future together, on Base.”',

      body: '***Discover how visionary artist Ryan Hawthorne\'s work \'Onchain + Optimistic\' was inspired by the promise of an interconnected Superchain future, where collective action and creativity thrive.***\n\nWhat if the future of the internet is less reliant on centralized services, putting the power in the hands of each participant? That’s the vision of the [Optimism Collective](https://www.optimism.io/). Powered by the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), an open-source codebase that enables the development of L2s like OP Mainnet and Base, Optimism is building towards an interconnected Superchain future where blockchain technology is interoperable and collaboration and standardization lead the way to a more unified approach to development and community growth.\n\nTo celebrate Onchain Summer and allude to this Superchain future, Optimism looked to Ryan Hawthorne, an artist whose work ‘Onchain + Optimistic’ encapsulates the upward trajectory of onchain communities and nods to the OP Stack’s open-source principles. This visual ode reverberates with a promise of the Superchain future where builders, creators, and communities harness the power of the new internet to coordinate, collaborate, and thrive.\n\n"I got into this space,” says Hawthorne, “Because I sensed an opportunity for artists and creators that I hadn’t ever seen before." For Ryan, immersion in the space came alongside a profound realization of the importance of owning what you create. "To take ownership of your art in a way that\'s never really been done before made me excited," he asserts.\n\nTo get to that idyllic future, there’s a lot of work to be done. As Makena Walsh, team member at OP Labs which is a contributor to the Optimism protocol, aptly states, "Even as a crypto-native person, it can be quite difficult to accomplish some things onchain. It needs to be much simpler for anyone to come into crypto and build a dapp, create an NFT collection, participate in governance, or do something onchain with the click of a few buttons." This push for accessibility drives the ongoing effort to make onchain interactions easier for everyone, democratizing access to the technology.\n\nIncreased adoption of the OP Stack signifies a shift towards a more inclusive, collaborative, and user-empowered digital realm. As Walsh underscores, "We are at the whim and mercy of these megalithic tech companies." This mission to restore the internet as a global public utility is a call to action, inviting all to partake in reshaping the digital landscape.\n\nThe interwoven fabric of onchain communities, creators, and collectors propels us toward an internet that is not merely a tool, but a collective endeavor. It’s also an encouragement to participate. "The best way to learn about crypto,” says Hawthorne, “is by getting your hands dirty." It’s time to collectively create a future where openness prevails, connectivity thrives, and the internet is restored to its place as a global public utility, accessible to all who dig in.',

This very ethos propels Atari's venture into the onchain landscape as well, seeking to continue the legacy of innovation. Drewitz reinforces this sentiment, stating, \"We're taking a look back at what made Atari become an iconic brand, and trying to bring it onchain.\"\n\nAs Drewitz says, \"We are building Atari X to be a gateway to different experiences using new technologies.\" This gateway serves as a testament to Atari's enduring mission of providing avenues for individuals to immerse themselves in novel and captivating encounters. \"Being onchain makes everything so much easier,” says Drewitz, “Especially within a gaming ecosystem where interoperability can start to become viable. Atari's place as a connecting point.\"\n\nFor Onchain Summer, Atari is resurrecting the essence of its iconic 80s computer camps in an onchain manifestation. “In the 80s there were Atari Summer Computer Camps,” says Drewitz, “and we're traveling back to 1982 with this retro-inspired Atari Summer Camp collection.\"\n\nWith a rich history that spans decades, Atari's legacy of creating joyous and immersive experiences is finding renewed energy in the onchain era.",

      body: '***Uncover the hidden layers of onchain activity through RainbowWorld\'s dynamic Citizens, which traverse onchain realms and offer an interactive journey into the future of the internet.***\n\n<https://onchainsummer.xyz/rainbow>\n\nRainbow, a trusted mobile wallet, has been spending a lot of time thinking about what’s next — and they’re working with AdWorld to bring the vision to Base for Onchain Summer.\n\nAs Tim Gruber, the partnerships expert at Rainbow, says, "Rainbow is becoming more than just a mobile wallet. We\'re an ecosystem, and we\'re gonna keep growing this product suite into what we call RainbowWorld." Central to the RainbowWorld experience is the concept of "citizens," customizable digital personas created by an onchain art studio AdWorld which serve as the embodiment of each individual\'s presence. Co-founder of AdWorld, gfsurvivor, explains the significance of citizens, stating, "Thematically, this character can kind of traverse between all the different onchain worlds. It\'s a citizen that doesn\'t belong specifically in Adworld, but in the greater ecosystem."\n\nTo bring this vision to life, the collaboration between Rainbow and AdWorld has resulted in the creation of not only a unique character creator, but a tool called ‘X-Scan’, an innovative feature that allows users to personalize their characters based on other onchain assets they own. Santangelo, the creative force behind AdWorld, says that "Having something like RainbowWorld be one of the first things Base users collect helps expand the idea of what an NFT can be. Citizens exist to be fluid. You can change this thing, it changes along with you, it tracks what\'s in your wallet and applies that in a visual and interactive way."\n\nAt the core of this transformative movement is the desire to empower artists. Pedro Bello, the artist behind the AdWorld citizens, revels in the newfound opportunities onchain technology has brought to the creative space. "Taking my art onchain has allowed me to find a space to experiment and an audience that\'s excited about digital work. I feel truly blessed that I got into this space in the past few years, and I love how making onchain art is an interactive experience that’s always changing."\n\nMike Demarais, the co-founder of Rainbow, believes that projects like RainbowWorld demonstrate the novel and interesting possibilities inherent in this onchain medium, saying that "Instead of just being a static one-and-done piece of media, this has the potential to connect a bunch of dots subconsciously in the mind of anyone new to this onchain space — and to do it in a way that can truly educate people." Demarais emphasizes the importance of a creator-friendly approach, saying, "I\'m just really excited to give people who might be new to crypto an opportunity to see how fun NFTs can be, and show them that there\'s all of these layers to it. I think it\'s gonna give people a chance to actually dive in and start playing with things as opposed to just more passively collecting."\n\nSpeaking to the visual aesthetic, Bello says “I grew up playing video games, so there\'s definitely a nostalgia element to it. I grew up glued to the TV. The aesthetics from my childhood give me a sense of comfort, a sense of curiosity. I want to make the things I saw in those worlds, and I like that, I\'m now part of its history to a certain degree.” Through a harmonious blend of nostalgia and cutting-edge tech, RainbowWorld exemplifies the metamorphic potential of a more interactive and interconnected onchain internet.',

At that point, companies like Blizzard looked at that success and created games that became worldwide phenomena.”\n\nNow, Iskra believes that we’re at a similar crossroads, with an onchain ecosystem ready to catalyze a new paradigm shift that transforms today’s niche into tomorrow’s global phenomena. “We really believe that content is going to be a key to taking this ecosystem mainstream,” says Colayco. “If you look at the rest of the world, especially emerging markets, where we are focused in, people are extremely open to the changes that the blockchain can provide.”\n\nIskra is bringing their latest game to Onchain Summer. A collectible battle RPG that seamlessly melds fast-paced monster battles with captivating tournament rounds, ClashMon draws players into a world brimming with competitive excitement. Yet, in a testament to Iskra's holistic design philosophy, the game also offers moments of tranquility through a fishing mode, allowing players to gather resources and take a breather from intense battles.\n\nIskra is building much more than game experiences, creating its own ecosystem. “We're one of the first all-in-one onchain game platforms,” says Colayco, “Where you have not just different kinds of games, but also different services. We have our own wallet, our own DEX, a launchpad, a market, all these other services that go all together. So it's all in one place.” A distinctive facet of this approach lies in its unique community system, an innovative model which shares platform fees with the players and game studios, rewarding them based on their active participation.\n\nIskra is confident that they’re onto something, and that it’s only a matter of time until the whole world joins them. \"Once this is proven to be not only lucrative but sustainable,” says Colayco, “I feel like it's a matter of time before large companies like Epic start making big moves.\"",

      body: '***In the vibrant city of Oakland, a transformative movement is underway fueled by the power of onchain technology. At its heart lies Oak, a community currency founded by Darrell Jones, dedicated to creating a thriving local economy which empowers small businesses.***\n\nYou can find Darrell Jones at the West Oakland Farmers Market, week after week. Over the past few months he’s worked with over a dozen merchants to facilitate thousands of dollars of transactions, helping each of them bring their business onchain. This is the power of Oak, which exists not only to create a microcosm of commerce, but to bypass traditional financial intermediaries. “We don’t want these merchants to give their money away to Visa with every transaction," Jones explains. The farmer’s market is an excellent showcase of the potential that onchain technology can bring to small businesses, promoting their growth and also keeping money circulating within the community. \n\nBeyond financial empowerment, Oak is committed to fostering inclusivity. By bridging the gap between communities of color and cryptocurrency adoption, the project has successfully onboarded over 1,000 residents in the Oakland area, providing easy on-ramps for those unfamiliar with digital assets. Financial inclusion, after all, is the cornerstone of a fair and community-oriented economic system.\n\nLooking to the future, Oak envisions the integration of onchain transactions into more payment processing avenues. Jones notes, "Maybe the point-of-sale units these local businesses are using will make onchain transactions as easy as a click of the button." Such seamless adoption of onchain technology is essential to fuel widespread change.\n\nOak stands as a model for other cities seeking to leverage onchain technology for community development. Part of the larger City3 project, Oak seeks to disseminate tools and strategies for bringing cities onchain, inspiring others to follow suit and create positive change within their own communities.\n\nThe transformative power of Oak\'s onchain initiative extends beyond its geographical boundaries. With a vision for a fair and just economic and political system, Oak aims to create a blueprint. As Jones passionately states, "We want the world to see that there is a faction of crypto that cares about community, that\'s very diverse, and that is using the technology to try and bring about a better world."\n\nBy bringing small businesses onchain, Oak\'s use of onchain technology in empowering small businesses and promoting community resilience in Oakland is a testament to the positive role of onchain technology in shaping the future of the internet.',
