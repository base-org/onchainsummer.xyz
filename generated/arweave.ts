For the first time, developers were able to build applications that connected people no matter where they lived, bringing them together to read, write, and share information. This unlocked incredible new products, including streaming, search, social media, smartphones, and more.\n\nToday, we believe we’re on the verge of the next massive transformation: onchain. Onchain is the next generation of the internet that will increase economic freedom globally by putting ownership back in the hands of everyday people — and it’s growing fast.\n\nBase Day One commemorates that story, and acknowledges the fact that it will evolve as more people come onchain and collectively create what comes next.\n\nBase is for everyone. Mint to join us as we bring the world onchain.","timestamp":"1691600201","title":"Welcome to Base, Day One"},"digest":"ai7vJwJ6SAd5AucQ9CbhYb-iZDLulaGkPYkJHSdjlXw","authorship":{"contributor":"0xd3271DF159F18E07AAD79E79A24580BB5c4776e9","signingKey":"{\"crv\":\"P-256\",\"ext\":true,\"key_ops\":[\"verify\"],\"kty\":\"EC\",\"x\":\"rYILR2cCccpVaiJqcXmOcAadgUvcTI8_15GhQfhNUJU\",\"y\":\"rr7TXKDoBIc7_tBgChmfmnO6mJjg5UrZBYAlOa2sp8c\"}","signature":"0xc3dfaf0914e577e872891b6253201c59df80b1098fa690259b9c33a6072ea0d841b4d295b56a7cd2201a57fccc16875702e9886a3f55c25c68f7ae10be988b671b","signingKeySignature":"jarkM_-owdaXOCIWFu9Goto72E82__ctg-0U2EhI6zDRyWTKuWKa0lAvJTgs_faREUi7itAT2tnNRfTqtxHJAQ","signingKeyMessage":"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\n{\"crv\":\"P-256\",\"ext\":true,\"key_ops\":[\"verify\"],\"kty\":\"EC\",\"x\":\"rYILR2cCccpVaiJqcXmOcAadgUvcTI8_15GhQfhNUJU\",\"y\":\"rr7TXKDoBIc7_tBgChmfmnO6mJjg5UrZBYAlOa2sp8c\"}","algorithm":{"name":"ECDSA","hash":"SHA-256"}},"version":"04-25-2022","wnft":{"chainId":10,"description":"Mint on onchainsummer.xyz/base\n","fundingRecipient":"0xd3271DF159F18E07AAD79E79A24580BB5c4776e9","imageURI":"QmXAxKjzK3U623ZtNEKjok7SXRNyBNs89d2ozB2n7Ly5Xm","mediaAssetId":644383,"name":"Welcome to Base, Day One","nonce":4960588,"owner":"0xd3271DF159F18E07AAD79E79A24580BB5c4776e9","price":0,"proxyAddress":"0xa9EDAfa73151B5D88C0493FCc27603f32862f0c3","renderer":"0xfd7c7F0B10ACDD4F2Ee2Ea5111767B98d42D0a07","supply":0,"symbol":"WELCOMETOBASEDAYONE","hasCustomWnftMedia":false}},"BtttCd5ecU0USQhFQ9wGZCmQ1Exq-nEhSUDViy0B_RY":{"content":{"body":"***Learn about the digital renaissance of onchain art through the visionary vantage point of Cozomo de’ Medici, a prolific and notorious anonymous collector.*** ***Mint on [onchainsummer.xyz/fwb](https://onchainsummer.xyz/fwb)***\n\n\"My story started by accident,” recalls the anonymous art collector known only as Cozomo de’ Medici. “I found this growing community of digital artists in the summer of 2021 like so many others. Back then, digital art was bundled together with all sorts of speculative projects. Two years later, digital art is its own category, with a growing ecosystem of collectors, artists and builders.”\n\nOver those years, Cozomo has amassed a collection of art worth millions of dollars, donated notable works to the LACMA, and had his identity questioned again and again (at one point, Twitter was convinced he was Snoop Dogg — [which Snoop Dogg teasingly affirmed](https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1440038460417474567?lang=en)). Yet beyond the speculation, Cozomo has proven himself to be a forward-thinking visionary who’s capable of recognizing the power of both the past and the future. \"I'm grateful to stand on the shoulders of those who paved this path for us all,” says Cozomo, “The artists minting work that wouldn’t even sell for pennies at the time. Things like [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) that were *free* to claim. It’s those early creatives who are the real visionaries of this movement.\"\n\nIt’s because of this deep level of understanding in the art space that Cozomo was asked by [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/), a social community of creatives and artists, to curate their contribution to Onchain Summer. Cozomo commissioned DeeKay Motion, a master animator and one of the definitive stars of the digital art movement, to create ‘New Era’. “To commemorate the launch of such a significant step for the onchain space,” says Alex Zhang, the Mayor of FWB, “we wanted to bring together two major figures of the ecosystem.” Cozomo himself owns several pieces of DeeKay’s collection, one of which was acquired for $1 million dollars in April of 2022. \"And now DeeKay has created something that everyone can have in their wallet,\" says Cozomo excitedly.\n\nSo what *is* Cozomo’s vision for the future?\n\n\"We’ve seen major museums embrace crypto art, digitally native artists sell works at major auction houses, traditional art collectors acquire digital works into their collection, and much more. So I see Onchain Summer as a manifestation of how far we have come.\"\n\nYet he believes we have a long way to go. \"What is holding some artists and collectors back,” says Cozomo, “is the actual chain. Not too long ago, artists couldn't afford to mint new art, as the transaction fees on ETH were too high. That cost would be priced into the artwork. That’s what makes the idea of Base exciting: A secure chain that is affordable to millions of artists, that can be collected by billions worldwide. That is what will allow this movement to rise even further.”\n\nCozomo hopes that many more follow in his footsteps and participate in this burgeoning digital renaissance. \"The odds of you being alive at the birth of a major art movement is close to zero,” says Cozomo. “If you are participating in Onchain Summer, you are not only here to see the birth of a major art movement, but you are actually able to help shape it. That to me is incredibly exciting.\"","timestamp":"1691684059","title":"The Digital Renaissance of Onchain Summer with FWB"},"digest":"EVw83YoW9TjObAUbLQammzEAdNn3Agi4YyQ5v0IMEUY","authorship":{"contributor":"0xd3271DF159F18E07AAD79E79A24580BB5c4776e9","signingKey":"{\"crv\":\"P-256\",\"ext\":true,\"key_ops\":[\"verify\"],\"kty\":\"EC\",\"x\":\"rYILR2cCccpVaiJqcXmOcAadgUvcTI8_15GhQfhNUJU\",\"y\":\"rr7TXKDoBIc7_tBgChmfmnO6mJjg5UrZBYAlOa2sp8c\"}","signature":"0xc3dfaf0914e577e872891b6253201c59df80b1098fa690259b9c33a6072ea0d841b4d295b56a7cd2201a57fccc16875702e9886a3f55c25c68f7ae10be988b671b","signingKeySignature":"FM6tH69zWyDj8BDlyn_HcXV2uD3Cbcs7SaCmVU4f2Y67DfwKorrajT2lZIvshgaNo_sG7_s2PrD0ZlDRvp5l9A","signingKeyMessage":"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\n{\"crv\":\"P-256\",\"ext\":true,\"key_ops\":[\"verify\"],\"kty\":\"EC\",\"x\":\"rYILR2cCccpVaiJqcXmOcAadgUvcTI8_15GhQfhNUJU\",\"y\":\"rr7TXKDoBIc7_tBgChmfmnO6mJjg5UrZBYAlOa2sp8c\"}","algorithm":{"name":"ECDSA","hash":"SHA-256"}},"version":"04-25-2022","wnft":{"chainId":10,"description":"Learn about the digital renaissance of onchain art through the visionary vantage point of Cozomo de’ Medici, a prolific and notorious anonymous collector.

Grab the Mirror content digest from the end of a Mirror post URL. The URL for this post is `dev.mirror.xyz/GjssNdA6XK7VYynkvwDem3KYwPACSU9nDWpR5rei3hw` and so the digest is `GjssNdA6XK7VYynkvwDem3KYwPACSU9nDWpR5rei3hw`\n2. We’re going to plug this digest value into a query against [Arweave’s graphQL endpoint](https://www.google.com/search?q=arweave+graphql&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS932US932&oq=arweave+graphql&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61j69i60.2079j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to render the data\n3. We’re going to make use of a couple of tags to get the Arweave transaction via GraphQL. Every post on Mirror has a few tags we can use to filter for the content:\n   1. `App-Name: MirrorXYZ` tells Arweave to scope the results to all posts on Mirror\n   2. `Original-Content-Digest: GjssNdA6XK7VYynkvwDem3KYwPACSU9nDWpR5rei3hw` tells Arweave to return every single transaction that matches the requested content digest\n   3. By default, we upload every single published update on a post to Arweave, so the query returns a list. To get the most recently published update sent to Arweave, we just sort the results by block height and grab the newest transaction.\n4. Once, we have the Transaction ID we need, we can use the `getData` function in the [Arweave JS SDK](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js) to render the JSON content\n   1. We can also verify that we have the correct transaction ID navigating to `arweave.net/<TRANSACTION_ID>` which will render the JSON\n   2. Our digest `GjssNdA6XK7VYynkvwDem3KYwPACSU9nDWpR5rei3hw` returns a transaction ID of `dysIrCovgAHJ6siGA5_r27Q59j2tv5wD4kqc1bxRFVE`, which renders the content you see [here](https://arweave.net/RM2C8OKruS_UmORwvyv1Q1w0e0aQaZWFRzFL1eGgpLg).\n\nThe GraphQL query is available as a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/saarim-mirror/2605fda5baf8b428385c872f6eb5d6d5).\n\nIn order to bypass requiring content digests to populate Mirror posts, you can use the `Contributor` tag to query for all posts made by a specific wallet. A full list of available tags is available on the `Transaction` GraphQL object.","timestamp":1649101356,"title":"Retrieving posts directly from Arweave"},"digest":"SZ3uJdUzsN84mgFegfpWadXXdGyMN8c82dDdeQ2Hqo8","authorship":{"contributor":"0xbDc4199575A5FA3F19e9888C5d51Bde798F404Cc","signingKey":"{\"crv\":\"P-256\",\"ext\":true,\"key_ops\":[\"verify\"],\"kty\":\"EC\",\"x\":\"ZuI92nV-lWAU5JzmextwvHr6far-KmDeisH1UBm76kI\",\"y\":\"1WSCKrhyo079aoa_Lc9NgTU-_GzeQyekPQYx9yZjWno\"}","signature":"WulpvqP7BUZNdYDhmIrdwInBmdpm2Z05LtL982-0SfYiYSfgsdkuJjDN6_V5_GsC2AWsUwP9_E6VE5huSHxW2g","signingKeySignature":"0x3aff95b6b112e38b6a36549ff942a77f65dce3030b47f336eb1ce3a8a617de51700f27e00bbb64a49a4398a6a1c6e54e9fbbb3f0cda8d53b8031a1771bbc12581c","signingKeyMessage":"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\n{\"crv\":\"P-256\",\"ext\":true,\"key_ops\":[\"verify\"],\"kty\":\"EC\",\"x\":\"ZuI92nV-lWAU5JzmextwvHr6far-KmDeisH1UBm76kI\",\"y\":\"1WSCKrhyo079aoa_Lc9NgTU-_GzeQyekPQYx9yZjWno\"}","algorithm":{"name":"ECDSA","hash":"SHA-256"}},"nft":{},"version":"12-21-2020","originalDigest":"GjssNdA6XK7VYynkvwDem3KYwPACSU9nDWpR5rei3hw"},"":{"content":{"body":"im good","timestamp":"1657046626","title":"petis"},"digest":"nIJWGywAVkuFY_Q3HzKRsP8UmkTlvZVF31Vof90u_TU","authorship":{"contributor":"0xf9e0206f9f020DE9423A80ace7A64B322D0CE334","signingKey":"{\"crv\":\"P-256\",\"ext\":true,\"key_ops\":[\"verify\"],\"kty\":\"EC\",\"x\":\"hSt6BW_TbApshx0mIsqnN2AT0uf2OnpR5-FY_eIcl08\",\"y\":\"6mCANzo8luqeCwGSg-DbA3SR1ZJ9mJ2kFgcNQ-R3S4A\"}","signature":"0xa5b56563c6f7af980d0bba9a5b298a5c1e7cd25b7e05e239713a3e99e90e95bc0acfb7bf53f5c1d74526e44fdea471cae3c5f48a82a83964acf5678eabbd47f01c","signingKeySignature":"dDbEgnrp9nss4FaEQ2xIwXsXJhgP_jHAuW6jPhVv6zX9fvSj_GwY8nNOqs8kv2bfHRgyebY2_EJhmj7p9afNGw","signingKeyMessage":"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\n{\"crv\":\"P-256\",\"ext\":true,\"key_ops\":[\"verify\"],\"kty\":\"EC\",\"x\":\"hSt6BW_TbApshx0mIsqnN2AT0uf2OnpR5-FY_eIcl08\",\"y\":\"6mCANzo8luqeCwGSg-DbA3SR1ZJ9mJ2kFgcNQ-R3S4A\"}","algorithm":{"name":"ECDSA","hash":"SHA-256"}},"version":"04-25-2022","wnft":{"chainId":10,"description":"im good\n","fee":250,"fundingRecipient":"0xf9e0206f9f020DE9423A80ace7A64B322D0CE334","imageURI":"bafybeid55mp2l4bb2eqitubfczpdqfd7vzy5tnf52pall2kv5cl2uu5jwm","mediaAssetId":114049,"name":"petis","nonce":4916544,"owner":"0xf9e0206f9f020DE9423A80ace7A64B322D0CE334","price":0.01,"proxyAddress":"0x9177f6dE23A13AEd9fee7FC04403c6a175c48b46","renderer":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000","supply":100,"symbol":"PETIS"}}}
